- **Custom U-Net Models**: Support for user-trained segmentation networks
- **Multi-channel Support**: Phase contrast, fluorescence, and brightfield imaging

### ðŸ§  **AI-Powered Cell Cycle Classification**
- **6 Pre-trained TensorFlow Models**: Specialized for different imaging conditions
  - DNA+Membrane (Epifluorescence & SIM)
  - DNA-only (Epifluorescence & SIM)  
  - Membrane-only (Epifluorescence & SIM)
- **Custom Model Support**: Load your own TensorFlow models
- **Automated Classification**: G1, S, G2, and division phase detection

### ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Analysis**
- **Morphological Measurements**: 50+ features using scikit-image regionprops
- **Colocalization Analysis**: Multi-channel fluorescence quantification
- **Interactive Filtering**: Real-time cell selection based on computed statistics
- **Professional Reports**: HTML reports with embedded plots and statistics

## Plugin Widgets

The plugin provides three main widgets accessible through the napari interface:

1. **Compute label**: Cell segmentation using StarDist2D, Cellpose, or custom models
