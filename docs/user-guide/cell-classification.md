# Cell Classification Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information about napari-mAIcrobe's cell classification system, including model selection, usage, and custom model integration.

## ðŸ§  Overview

napari-mAIcrobe uses deep learning models to automatically classify cells phases based on morphological and fluorescence features. The plugin includes 6 pre-trained models optimized for the cell cycle stage detection of _Staphylococcus aureus_ under various imaging conditions, but it also has support for user-trained custom models.

## ðŸ”¬ Pre-trained Models

napari-mAIcrobe includes 6 specialized models optimized for different imaging conditions and channel availability.

### DNA + Membrane Models

**S.aureus DNA+Membrane Epi**
- **Imaging**: Epifluorescence microscopy
- **Channels**: DNA stain (e.g., Hoechst) + Membrane stain (e.g., NileRed)
- **Use case**: Standard fluorescence imaging with both channels

**S.aureus DNA+Membrane SIM**
- **Imaging**: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)
- **Channels**: DNA stain + Membrane stain
- **Use case**: Super-resolution imaging for detailed morphology

### DNA Only Models

**S.aureus DNA Epi**
- **Imaging**: Epifluorescence microscopy
- **Channels**: DNA stain only
- **Use case**: When membrane staining is not available/desired
- **Accuracy**: Good, but lower than dual-channel models or membrane-only models

**S.aureus DNA SIM**
- **Imaging**: Structured illumination microscopy
- **Channels**: DNA stain only
- **Use case**: When membrane staining is not available/desired
- **Accuracy**: Good, but lower than dual-channel models or membrane-only models

### Membrane Only Models

**S.aureus Membrane Epi**
- **Imaging**: Epifluorescence microscopy
- **Channels**: Membrane stain only
- **Use case**: When DNA staining is not available/desired
- **Accuracy**: Comparable to dual-channel models, often better than DNA-only models

**S.aureus Membrane SIM**
- **Imaging**: Structured illumination microscopy
- **Channels**: Membrane stain only
- **Use case**: When DNA staining is not available/desired
- **Accuracy**: Comparable to dual-channel models, often better than DNA-only models

## ðŸ“Š Model Selection Guide

Choose the appropriate model based on your experimental setup:

### Decision Tree

```
Do you have both DNA and membrane staining?
â”œâ”€â”€ Yes: DNA+Membrane models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Super-resolution imaging? â†’ S.aureus DNA+Membrane SIM
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Standard resolution? â†’ S.aureus DNA+Membrane Epi
â””â”€â”€ No: Single-channel models
    â”œâ”€â”€ DNA staining only?
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Super-resolution? â†’ S.aureus DNA SIM
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Standard resolution? â†’ S.aureus DNA Epi
    â””â”€â”€ Membrane staining only?
        â”œâ”€â”€ Super-resolution? â†’ S.aureus Membrane SIM
        â””â”€â”€ Standard resolution? â†’ S.aureus Membrane Epi
```
